unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Our Client
Segment customers consist primarily of PC OEMs, a network of independent
distributors and, for chipset products, ODMs that manufacture motherboards.
Our Gaming Segment customers include PC OEMs and independent distributors as
well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs), independent game console and
portable gaming devices manufacturers and contract manufacturers for AMD
branded graphics cards.Our Embedded Segment products are sold to customers in
a very wide range of markets such as aerospace and defense, automotive,
industrial, vision and healthcare, communications infrastructure, test
measurement, emulation and prototyping, audio, video and broadcasting, and
data center. For these products, we either sell directly to our customers or
through a network of distributors and OEM partners. We are also developing a
network of Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Integrated Solution Vendors (ISVs)
for our Alveo products.We work closely with our customers to define product
features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are
developing meet our customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to
assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that
incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service
and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters
relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our
products.We also work with our customers to create differentiated products
that leverage our CPU, GPU, APU, DPU and FPGA technology. Certain customers
pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and
a purchase price for the resulting products.7Table of ContentsOriginal
Equipment ManufacturersWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-
nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system
integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes.
Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners’
business; however, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which
resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB)
segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system
integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and
services solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud
Service Provider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and
domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC
motherboards and game consoles.Hyperscale Data CentersLarge multi-national
public cloud service providers and hyperscale private data centers directly
and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused
products, including server CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive
SOCs. These products are incorporated into servers and other data center
appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom servers or
hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or
contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate
web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage
service offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as
generative AI models.Third-Party DistributorsOur authorized channel
distributors resell to sub-distributors, OEMs, ODMs, and other customers.
Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, and may include
products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors
typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our
agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against
price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any product
that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to
discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may
contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product
returns.Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System IntegratorsWe offer
component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn
build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators
(SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with
AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also
sell directly to some SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of
regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on
short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often
use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and
add value to their customers.CompetitionThe markets in which our products are
sold are highly competitive and delivering the latest and best products to
market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe
that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are total
cost of ownership, timely product introductions, product quality, product
features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as
AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, given
their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or
form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the
creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and
hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design
tools, completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability,
brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue
to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product
introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may
provide better performance or experiences or that may include additional
features that render our products comparatively less competitive. 8Table of
ContentsCompetition in Data Center SegmentIn the Data Center segment, we
compete primarily against Intel Corporation (Intel) and NVIDIA Corporation
(NVIDIA) with our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. In addition, we compete
against Intel with our FPGA and Adaptive SoC server products. A variety of
smaller fabless silicon companies offer proprietary accelerator solutions and
Arm based CPUs targeting data center use-cases. In addition, some of our
customers are internally developing their own data center microprocessor
products and accelerator products which could impact the available market for
our products.Competition in Client SegmentOur primary competitor in the supply
of CPUs and APUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have developed
Arm-based microprocessors and platforms which could lead to further adoption
of Arm-based PC solutions. Competition in Gaming SegmentIn the graphics
market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA,
who is the discrete GPU market share leader, and Intel, who manufactures and
sells integrated graphics processors and gaming-focused discrete GPUs. With
respect to integrated graphics, higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s
integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of
systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for
notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most
mainstream PC users at a lower cost. We are the market share leader in semi-
custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical.
Competition in Embedded Segment We expect continued competition from our
primary FPGA competitors such as Intel, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and
Microsemi Corporation, and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation,
Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., Analog Devices, Texas Instruments Incorporated
and NXP Semiconductors N.V., and from Qualcomm Incorporated and NVIDIA. In
addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been
ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Intel is our main competitor for
embedded CPUs. Other competitors include manufacturers of high-density
programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures; high-
volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;
ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; high-
speed, low-density CPLDs; high-performance DSP devices; products with embedded
processors; products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; discrete
general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and
other new or emerging programmable logic products.Research and Development We
focus our research and development (R&D;) activities on designing and
developing products. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next
generation of processors (CPU and GPU), FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs, accelerators
(adaptive, graphics and DPU), SOMs and SmartNICs and associated software. We
focus on designing, with security in mind, new integrated circuits (ICs) with
improved performance and performance-per-watt in advanced semiconductor
manufacturing processes, the design of logic and interface IP, advanced
packaging technologies, and heterogeneous integration technologies. We also
focus on software as part of the development of our products, including design
automation tools for hardware, embedded software, optimized software tools and
libraries that extend the reach of our platforms to software and AI
developers. Through our R&D; efforts, we were able to introduce a number of
new products and enhance our IP core offerings and software. We also work with
industry leaders on process technology, design tools, intellectual property,
software and other industry consortia to conduct early-stage R&D.; We are also
actively contributing to numerous industry open-source software initiatives
across a broad range of technologies. We conduct product and system R&D;
activities for our products in the United States with additional design and
development engineering teams located in various countries who undertake
specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters. 9Table of
ContentsManufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test FacilitiesThird-Party
Wafer Foundry FacilitiesWe utilize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
Limited (TSMC) for the production of wafers for our HPC, FPGA and Adaptive SoC
products and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), with respect to wafer purchases for
our HPC products at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes. Additionally, we
utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd. for the production of our ICs in the form of
programmable logic devices.Other Third-Party Manufacturers We outsource board-
level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers.Assembly,
Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities Wafers for our products are either sorted
by the foundry or delivered by the foundry to our assembly, test, mark and
packaging (ATMP) partners or subcontractors located in the Asia-Pacific region
who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two
ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics
Co., Ltd. The ATMP JVs, Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. (SPIL) and King
Yuan Electronics Company (KYEC) provide ATMP services for our products.
Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual
property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized
third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights,
patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights.
As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 7,500 patents in the United
States and approximately 1,900 patent applications pending in the United
States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign
jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have
approximately 18,800 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately
13,200 issued patents and 5,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file
future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant
inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual
patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our
business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-
licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which
we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We
have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies
that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices.
These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products.
We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source
software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools.
Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of
the design tools upon which our customers depend.BacklogSales are made
primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements
covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements
may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be
indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders
or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty.SeasonalityOur
operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has
been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of
the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact
these trends.Human CapitalAs of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 28,000
employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our
culture of innovation, creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds
work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us
include the following: Mission, Culture, and Engagement Our History - Founded
in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of
employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest
beginnings, we have grown into a global 10Table of Contentscompany achieving
many important industry firsts along the way. Today, we develop high-
performance and adaptive computing to solve some of the world’s toughest and
most interesting challenges. Our Vision - High performance and adaptive
computing is transforming our lives.Our Mission - Build great products that
accelerate next-generation computing experiences. Our employees are driven by
this vision and mission. Innovation occurs when creative minds and diverse
perspectives from all over the world work together. This is the foundation of
our unique culture and the reason we believe our employees are among the most
engaged in our industry. We conduct an annual survey of our global workforce
to measure our culture, engagement, and workplace experience. The results are
reviewed by our Board of Directors and acted upon by our senior leadership
team. Results from our 2024 survey reported scores that continued to be among
the very best for global companies in the technology industry. Our employees
described our culture as inclusive, innovative, open, and respectful, and
rated the quality of our managers high, and employment engagement is among the
top 10% of our high-performing technology industry peers. Diversity, Belonging
and Inclusion (DB&I;)Our diverse and inclusive workforce encourages employees
to share their opinions and different perspectives. We believe that building a
diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and
increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes our company
stronger. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are open to all our
employees, encourage employee engagement and play an important role in our
culture. More than 85% of all new hires join at least one of AMD’s ERGs when
starting employment. In 2024, we continued to focus on developing our female
engineering community through mentoring opportunities and expanding the
program, “Advancing Women in Technology,” that aims to support the career
development of women in technical careers at AMD.Total RewardsWe invest in our
workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits to ensure
that we continue to attract and retain the industry’s best and brightest in an
equitable manner. We regularly review our compensation practices, considering
factors relevant to ensuring equitable pay such as an employee’s role,
experience, skills, and performance. We also benchmark set pay ranges based on
relevant market data and our overall workforce. We focus on flexibility and
choice in our benefits that resonate with a multi-generational workforce as
well as offering inclusive benefits that support our DB&I; objectives, such as
global parental and bereavement leave, and financial assistance to build a
family through adoption or surrogacy. While we believe that there is unique
collaboration that can occur when employees meet in person, we embrace
flexibility with hybrid and remote work as options for our employees. We have
a strong pay for performance culture that we believe drives superior results.
Our employees have benefited from our robust financial results through our
strong short-term and long-term incentive programs. Our rewards programs
enable us to attract, retain and motivate our workforce.Development We offer
our employees opportunities to advance their careers at the Company and the
majority of our new leaders are promoted from within. We are focused on
leadership progression and encourage our employees to take advantage of new
opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are highly
rated, and we provide specialized development programs for our employees as
well as educational assistance in the form of tuition reimbursement for
eligible employees to continue their university education or achieve advanced
certifications. We have an enterprise-wide mentoring program where employees
have the opportunity to learn from experienced colleagues, develop new skills,
and build their professional networks. The program also supports effective
onboarding, helping new hires more quickly acclimate to our company culture
and work processes. We believe that our mentoring program is a valuable
investment in our workforce, and we are committed to its ongoing
success.11Table of ContentsEmployee VoiceAt AMD, we value the importance of
employee voice and actively engage in efforts to ensure that our employees'
opinions and perspectives are heard and considered. Our employee voice
strategy includes an annual AMDer Survey (engagement survey). Our scores rank
AMD in the top 10% of high-tech firms on similar questions, categories and
overall score. Additionally, we measure effectiveness across all elements of
the employee lifecycle, including onboarding, exit, and regularly seek out
employee feedback on areas including benefits and total rewards satisfaction.
Further, our executive team holds frequent employee roundtables, town halls
and global team meetings with question-and-answer segments which facilitate
open communication and feedback from our workforce. Government RegulationsOur
global operations are subject to various United States and foreign laws and
regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to export control,
customs, intellectual property, data privacy and security, climate,
environmental, health and safety requirements, cybersecurity, tax, employment,
competition and anti-trust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, conflict minerals,
corporate governance, financial and other disclosures, and AI. Compliance with
these governmental laws and regulations do not presently have a material
adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or
competitive position. However, compliance with changes to existing or new
regulations may have a material adverse impact on our future capital
expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. In addition, the
failure to comply with government laws and regulations may subject us to
consequences including fines, limits on our ability to sell our products,
suspension of certain of our business activities, reputational damage,
criminal and civil liabilities, and sanctions, which may have a material
adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or
competitive position. For additional information about government regulations
applicable to our business, and their potential impacts see Risk Factors in
Item 1A.Environmental Regulations Our operations and properties are subject to
various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those
relating to materials used in our products and the manufacturing processes of
our products, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment,
transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation
of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain
permits for operations in making our products, including the discharge of air
pollutants and wastewater. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently
and tend to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union
(EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted
restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products.
These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. Jurisdictions
including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have
finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and
servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy
consumption limits.Certain environmental laws, including the United States
Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and
several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property
for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose
liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability
even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the
release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess
liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to
disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be
contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they
never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a
responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale,
California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have
discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former
underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at
these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly
used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer
fabrication process prior to 1979.In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up
Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with
other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such
agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs
as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the
orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the
agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties
do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.12Table of
ContentsTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we
have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of
approximately $5.5 million and have not recorded any potential insurance
recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of
future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs
may change. We believe that any amount in addition to what has already been
accrued would not be material.Additional InformationAMD was incorporated under

15Table of ContentsEconomic and Strategic RisksIntel Corporation’s dominance
of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit
our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.Intel’s
microprocessor market share position, significant financial resources,
introduction of competitive new products, and existing relationships with top-
tier OEMs have enabled it to market and price its products aggressively, to
target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to
influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have
in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for
many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability.
Intel also dominates the computer system platform and has a heavy influence on
PC manufacturers, other PC industry participants, and benchmarks. It is able
to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that
could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.
We may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices,
including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions designed to
limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules;
product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; and exclusivity
payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel
partners. We expect Intel to continue to heavily invest substantial resources
in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other
technology companies.Nvidia’s dominance in the graphics processing unit market
and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete
effectively on a level playing field.Nvidia’s Data Center GPU market share
position, significant financial resources, introduction of competitive new
products and proprietary software ecosystem have enabled it to market and
price its products in a manner to encourage the selection of Nvidia-based
systems and to influence customers who do business with us. We may be
materially adversely affected by Nvidia’s business practices, including
allocation strategies and pricing actions; product mix and introduction
schedules; and product bundling strategies. Nvidia’s practices can limit
customers’ ability to choose non-Nvidia products, including our products, and
in turn, may limit our market share and decrease our margins and
profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We
expect Nvidia to continue to heavily invest substantial resources in research
and development, marketing and other technology companies.The markets in which
our products are sold are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. The markets
in which our products are sold are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We
expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological
changes, new and evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences
and requirements, and frequent introductions by our competitors or new
competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that
may include additional features that render our products comparatively less
competitive. In addition, we are entering markets with current and new
competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and
emerging technologies. For example, the AI market is subject to rapid
technological change, product obsolescence, frequent new product introductions
and feature enhancements, changes in end-user requirements and evolving
industry trends and legal standards. We cannot guarantee that we will be able
to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have
stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate
customer requirements and emerging industry trends. While we see significant
opportunity in AI, we expect intense competition from companies such as Nvidia
in the supply of GPUs and other accelerators for the AI market. We may face
competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same
products as us. Increased adoption of Arm-based semiconductor designs could
lead to further growth and development of the Arm ecosystem. We may also face
delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be
required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development
than anticipated. In addition, the semiconductor industry has seen several
mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation
could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers,
customers and partners in the industry.16Table of ContentsWe believe that the
main factors that determine our product competitiveness are total cost of
ownership, timely product introductions, product quality, product features and
capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI, energy
efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, given their impact
on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor),
selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open
industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware
compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools,
completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability, brand
recognition and availability. If competitors introduce competitive new
products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely
impacted and our business could be adversely affected. Further, our
competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could
increase the competitive environment in a declining market or during
challenging economic times, leading to lower prices and a reduction in our
margins. To the extent our competitors introduce competitive new products and
technologies into the market before we do, or introduce products and
technologies that provide better performance/experience or at better prices,
our products and technologies may be comparatively less competitive and our
competitive position may weaken, which could adversely harm our business and
results of operations. From time to time, governments provide incentives or
make other investments that could benefit and give a competitive advantage to
our competitors. For example, the United States government enacted the
Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America and Science
Act (CHIPS Act) of 2022 to provide financial incentives to the U.S.
semiconductor industry. Government incentives, including the CHIPS Act, may
not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our competitors can
benefit from such government incentives and we cannot, it could strengthen our
competitors’ relative position and have a material adverse effect on our
business.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced
severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to
materially adversely affect, our business in the future.The semiconductor
industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often
in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations
in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and
declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses
in previous downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices;
the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor
industry; a decline in demand for end-user products that incorporate our
products; and excess inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment.
Such industry-wide fluctuations may materially adversely affect us in the
future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the
semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases,
which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance
has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns.
The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our
products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be
successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish
adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and
maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is
below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a
material adverse effect on us.The demand for our products depends in part on
the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations
in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Industry-
wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely
affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future.
We offer products that are used in different end markets and the demand for
our products can vary among our Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded end
markets. For instance, in our Data Center segment, we offer products that are
optimized for generative AI applications and since the fourth quarter of 2023,
we have experienced significant demand for our AI accelerators. The demand for
such products in part will depend on the extent to which our customers utilize
generative AI solutions in a wide variety of applications, and both the near-
term and long-term trajectory of such generative AI solutions is unknown.
Also, our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and
notebook PC segments and will depend in part on the market’s adoption of AI
PCs. We are actively building AI capabilities into all our Client products,
such as Ryzen AI PC processors, but there can be no assurance about the rate
and pace of adoption of such product offerings. In the past, revenues from the
Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other
factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition
and changes in replacement cycles. 17Table of ContentsIn addition, our GPU
revenue in the past has been affected in part by the volatility of the
cryptocurrency mining market. If we are unable to manage the risks related to
the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market (including potential
actions by global monetary authorities), our GPU business could be materially
adversely affected. The success of our semi-custom SoC products in our Gaming
segment is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline
and consumer market conditions, including the success of game console systems
and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft. Our Embedded segment
primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, APUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC
products some of which are subject to macroeconomic trends and volatile
business conditions. To the extent our embedded customers are faced with
higher inventory levels, they may choose to draw down their existing inventory
and order less of our products. For example, our Embedded segment revenue
decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize their inventory
levels.The success of our business depends on our ability to introduce
products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide
value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant
industry transitions.Our success depends to a significant extent on the
development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product
designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to
identify industry changes, and adapt our strategy to develop, qualify and
distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to
meet evolving industry trends and requirements, at prices acceptable to our
customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our
competitiveness in our target markets. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to meet the evolving needs of industry changes or that our efforts to
execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and
technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed
in identifying, developing, qualifying or shipping new products or
technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends,
or if we fail to predict which new form factors, product features preferences
or requirements consumers will adopt and adapt our business accordingly, we
may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share
and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we
make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain
that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products
and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our
customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve
certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New
investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated
liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from
our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in
new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations
and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and
operating results. For example, as part of our pervasive AI strategy, we have
a portfolio of hardware products and software tools to allow our customers to
develop scalable and pervasive AI solutions. We are actively building AI
capabilities into our products, but there can be no assurance about the rate
and pace of adoption of such product offerings. In our Data Center segment, we
offer products that are optimized for generative AI applications and since the
fourth quarter of 2023, we have experienced significant demand for our AI
accelerators. The demand for such products in part will depend on the extent
to which our customers utilize generative AI solutions in a wide variety of
applications, and both the near-term and long-term trajectory of such
generative AI solutions is unknown. If we fail to develop and timely offer or
deploy such products and technologies, keep pace with the product offerings of
our competitors, or adapt to unexpected changes in industry standards or
disruptive technological innovation, our business could be adversely affected.
Additionally, our efforts in developing new AI technology solutions are
inherently risky and may not always succeed. We may incur significant costs,
resources, investments and delays and not achieve a return on investment or
capitalize on the opportunities presented by demand for AI solutions.
Moreover, while AI adoption is likely to continue and may accelerate, the
long-term trajectory of this technological trend is uncertain. 18Table of
ContentsDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also
cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases,
breach contractual obligations. If our customers do not include our products
in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will
typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the
next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a
customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss
a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of
market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing
of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product
launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with
our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market
and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could
materially adversely affect our business. The increasing frequency and
complexity of our newly introduced products may result in unanticipated
quality or production issues that could result in product delays. In addition,
market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance
standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the
sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products
and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall
corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products
with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable
of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over
time, our business could be materially adversely affected.The loss of a
significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.We depend on a
small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and we
expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a
significant part of our revenue and receivables in the future. If one of our
key customers decides to stop buying our products, materially reduces its
operations or its demand for our products, or has operations that are
materially impaired for a significant period of time such that it is unable to
receive or utilize our products, or pay its liabilities, our business would be
materially adversely affected.Economic and market uncertainty may adversely
impact our business and operating results.Uncertain global or regional
economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business.
Uncertainty in the economic environment or other unfavorable changes in
economic conditions, such as inflation, higher interest rates, recession,
slowing growth, increased unemployment, tighter credit markets, changes in
fiscal monetary or trade policy, or currency fluctuations, may negatively
impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to stop or
postpone purchases. For example, our Embedded segment revenue decreased in
2024 as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. During
challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may
experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel
plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not
successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing,
they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that
they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or
delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of
customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any
inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our
products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key
suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely
impacting our ability to manufacture our products. Adverse changes in economic
conditions could increase costs of memory, equipment, materials or substrates
and other supply chain expenses. If we are not able to procure a stable supply
of materials on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our
production requirements, we could experience a supply shortage or an increase
in production costs, which could negatively impact our gross margin and
materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to forecast our
operating results, make business decisions and execute our business strategy
could be adversely impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions. In
addition, uncertain economic conditions could lead to higher borrowing costs
and reduced availability of capital and credit markets, making it more
difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales
of debt or equity securities. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty
could also lead to failures of counterparties including financial institutions
and insurers, asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial
instruments. If a banking institution in which we hold funds fails or is
subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets,
we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of such uninsured
funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such uninsured
funds, which in turn could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and
ability to meet our operating expense obligations. 19Table of ContentsOur
operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.The
profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large
portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month
of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each
financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations
in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating
results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are
sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in
the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although
market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of
the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond
our control.If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other
intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a
competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.We rely on a combination
of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and
nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law
rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology
or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from
misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or
issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or
rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to
us.Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of
a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form
that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual
property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate
our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is
difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property
on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where
foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in
the U.S. and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be
compromised, and our business would be materially adversely
affected.Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely
affect us.We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause
our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of
revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe
appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect
against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total
foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for
items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be
effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are
denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the
cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation
of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our
products.Operational and Technology RisksWe rely on third parties to
manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in
sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could
be materially adversely affected.We utilize third-party wafer foundries to
fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all
wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller
nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for
microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7
nm. We also utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for our integrated circuits (IC) in the form of
programmable logic devices. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to
assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package
assembly partners are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate
our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these
third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to
respond to customer demand.20Table of ContentsWe cannot guarantee that these
manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to
meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience
supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be
required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our
customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships
with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are
unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our
manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material
adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to
manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller
nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer
demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.We do not have
long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing
suppliers. We obtain many of these manufacturing services on a purchase order
basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any
specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing
purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a
portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to
produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields
and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable
prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for
other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to
prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge
us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate
deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
If we overestimate our customer demand or experience a decrease in customer
demand, either could result in excess inventory and an increase in our
production costs. We are party to a wafer supply agreement with GF where GF
will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us and set pricing
through 2026. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of
wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could
have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may
adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.Other risks
associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited
control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price
increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of
our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited
ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party
manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose
benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, water shortages,
or high heat events, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products,
encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials
from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency,
or experience uncertain environmental, social, atmospheric or natural,
economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply
delays or disruptions. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, we
experienced some inventory loss due to an incident at a contract manufacturer.
If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of products, our
ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could
materially affect our business.If we transition the production of some of our
products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product
introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we
experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient
capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other
reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely
secure an alternative supply for any specific product. We could experience
significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find
alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business.We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively,
the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The
majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no
guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP
requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or
late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a
material adverse effect on our business.21Table of ContentsIf essential
equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available
to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.We may
purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end
manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations
depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and
materials of acceptable quality on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers
also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment
and materials of acceptable quality in the manufacture of our products. In
addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on
our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue
meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that
are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited
number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a
limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of IC
packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly,
certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed
circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the
manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number
of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of memory,
equipment, materials or substrates of acceptable quality on an ongoing basis
and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could
experience a shortage in memory, equipment, materials or substrate supply or
an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment
arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery of such supply is
delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our
ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer
demand. Conversely, if we overestimate our customer demand or experience a
decrease in customer demand, either because customers cancel orders or choose
to purchase from our competitors, it could result in excess inventory and an
increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment
arrangements with certain suppliers. Because some of the equipment and
materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it
is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for
another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or
increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of
these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price,
quality and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the
industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential
materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers
exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these
materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party
manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products,
our business would be materially adversely affected. Failure to achieve
expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our
results of operations.Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of
product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is
typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from
design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or
a combination of some or all of these. Our third-party manufacturers are
responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If
our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or
encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail
to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. We
cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop,
expand, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge manufacturing process or
packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our
products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not
develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during
periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or
packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully
productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller
process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly
if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us.
For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product
microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able to
manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient
quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business. Moreover, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to
produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products.
Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC
products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process
technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields
and deliver them in a timely manner.Any decrease in manufacturing yields could
result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our
gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst
our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our
customers and materially adversely affect our business.22Table of ContentsOur
revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom
SoC products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of
those products.The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products
is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for
design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales
of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our
ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our
ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our
customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being
incorporated into those customers’ products. Any revenue from sales of our
semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s
products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no
control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make
any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or
future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us
may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely
affected.Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could
have a material adverse effect on us.The products that we sell are complex and
have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that
could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of
confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and
address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially
effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create
mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they
may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third
parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or
as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the
implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could
be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our
products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing
products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our
revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation
related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security
vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to
our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or results of
operations.IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt
operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive
information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our
business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.Our
business relies on technology hardware, software, cloud services,
infrastructure, networks and systems (collectively, IT Systems). We own and
manage some IT Systems but also rely on critical third-party IT Systems,
products and services. In the ordinary course of business, we and various
third-party providers and business partners process and maintain sensitive
data, including personal information about workers, customers and others, as
well as intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information
relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners
(collectively, Confidential Data). Maintaining the availability, integrity and
security of our IT Systems and Confidential Data is critical to our business
and reputation. While we and others have implemented various controls and
defenses, AMD and companies like AMD and our vendors and customers have been
and are increasingly subject to cybersecurity attacks, risks and threats.
Threat factors range in sophistication from individual hackers and insiders to
ransom gangs and state-sponsored attackers. Cyber threats may be generic, or
they may be custom-crafted against our IT Systems or supply chain. The
increased prevalence of remote working arrangements at AMD and our providers
present additional operational risks and attack vectors to our IT Systems. Our
IT Systems and Confidential Data are vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity
risks and threats, including malicious code that is added to widely available
open-source software, compromised commercial software or security
vulnerabilities in our products or systems, or those of a third party, that
are being used by attackers prior to mitigations being put in place, such as
zero-day attacks. Cyberattacks have and may come into our IT Systems through
the compromise of users’ access credentials. Users’ access credentials can be
compromised by phishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA)
prompt bombing, hacking, or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft
activities. 23Table of ContentsThreat actors are also increasingly using tools
and techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic
evidence, which means that we and others may be unable to implement adequate
preventative measures against, anticipate, detect, deflect, contain or recover
from cyberattacks in a timely or effective manner. As AI capabilities improve
and are increasingly adopted, we may see more sophisticated threats created
through the use of AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and
coordinated cyberattacks. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to
directly attack IT Systems with increased speed and/or efficiency than a human
threat actor or create more effective phishing emails. In addition, the threat
could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business
partners incorporating the output of an AI tool that includes a threat, such
as introducing malicious code by incorporating AI generated source code. Our
network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business
partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by
hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system
disruptions.Cyberattacks that breach our security measures, or those of our
third-party service providers, customers or business partners, could result in
any or all of the following, which individually or collectively could
materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position;
unauthorized access to, misuse or disclosure of Confidential Data (such as
intellectual property, sensitive business information or personally
identifiable information (PII)); reputational harm and/or diminution in our
competitiveness; loss of existing and/or future customers; litigation and/or
regulatory investigations or enforcement; significant remediation, restoration
and compliance costs; and the diversion of management’s attention and key
information technology resources. In addition, many governments have enacted
and are continuing to enact strict privacy and security laws, such as the UK’s
and European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California
Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which provide for fines, penalties, and in the case
of the CCPA and similar legislation, the basis for private claims for certain
types of data breaches. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to
enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs
related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components;
training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating,
responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any
related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm;
and complying with external regulations. Uncertainties involving the ordering
and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.We typically
sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not
have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase
requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack
quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products
more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We
base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their
products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our
products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up
purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is further complicated when our
products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and
customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by
multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. To the extent we fail to
forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase
production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between
supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet
customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of
our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to
rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change
their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, our
Embedded segment revenue decreased in 2024 as customers continued to normalize
their inventory levels. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated
growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction
due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or
obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an
adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage
of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in
turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. Excess or
obsolete inventory have resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-
downs of the value of our inventory. Factors that may result in excess or
obsolete inventory, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction
in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for
our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher
incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and
customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for
our products, including for our older products as our new products are
introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive
pricing actions. 24Table of ContentsOur ability to design and introduce new
products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual
property.In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely
on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for
software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on
intellectual property acquired from third parties that we incorporate into our
software or hardware. The design requirements necessary to meet customer
demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products
may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or
development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual
property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required
functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or
price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet
customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party
intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be
materially adversely affected.We depend on third-party companies for the
design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other
computer platform components to support our business and products.We depend on
third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards,
graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers, AI models or
tools), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell,
and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also
rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our
microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets
designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers,
AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other
components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current
or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or
laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially
adversely affected.If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products
or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our
products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely
affected.Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by
Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating
systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With
respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and
develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products.
Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU
products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and
developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to
design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86
instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating
systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may
forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our
innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition,
some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by
Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to
retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to
market our products would be materially adversely affected.Our reliance on
third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.We
market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and
AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for
convenience by either party upon prior notice. These agreements are non-
exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our
competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners
to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant
distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB
partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our
competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products
at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we
would be materially adversely affected. We extend credit to certain of our
distributors and AIB partners. If we are unable to collect accounts receivable
from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners or incur higher
allowances for credit losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our
third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to
focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially
adversely affected.25Table of ContentsAdditionally, distributors and AIB
partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances,
our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products
against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product
that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older
than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also
contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of
product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of
our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline
in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would
materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross
margin would decline.Our business depends on the proper functioning of our
internal business processes and information systems and modification or
interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal
controls.We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information
systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of
these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business
processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support
the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that
expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems
will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These
changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose
substantial demands on management time.These changes may also require changes
in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and
significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously
work on simplifying our information systems and applications through
consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our
business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with
this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party
information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable
to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including
catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or
malware, cyberattacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data
modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing
us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our
business.In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are
embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally
with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that
can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a
more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain
visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability
and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace
with the speed of these changes or if we are not able to meet regulatory and
compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely
affected.If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard
software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.Our products
may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and
hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility
problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve
compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely
affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem
relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our
business.Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse
effect on us.Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or
failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to
existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing
procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after
commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss
of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and
replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective
products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from
product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective
products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury,
damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible
property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In
addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the
defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs
to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could
materially adversely affect our business.26Table of ContentsWe could be
subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes,
or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible.
Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be
subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions
of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to
uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could
have a material adverse effect on our business.If we fail to maintain the
efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for
our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.Our ability
to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to
deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we
rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment
of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth
adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with
existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become
increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific
requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific
time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable
to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis
in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order
from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We
outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including
portions of our product distribution, transportation management and
information technology support services.We rely on third-party providers to
operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the
transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our
facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers. In
addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology
services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services,
business and software support applications, server and storage administration,
data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote
access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective
responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in
which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our
customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee
that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which
case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new
providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the
transition is not executed appropriately.Our inability to effectively control
the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse
effect on us.We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through
authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are
diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray
market.” Our inability to control gray market activities could result in
customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside
our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are
buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have
been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.
Additionally, products acquired on the gray market or through other
unauthorized channels are at higher risk of being re-sold to prohibited end-
users, misused, and deployed for uses that do not align with AMD’s ethics,
values or compliance standards. Gray market products result in shadow
inventory that is not visible to us, making it difficult to forecast demand
accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our
distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market
products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively
impacts our margins.27Table of ContentsClimate change may have a long-term
impact on our business.Climate change may have an adverse impact on our
business and the business of our suppliers and customers. Global climate
change may result in certain natural disasters and climate-related events
occurring with increasing frequency and severity and its physical impact on
the major regions where we have operations has the potential to disrupt our
business and those of our customers and suppliers. Our headquarters and some
of our operations and facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to
earthquakes and tsunamis, wildfires, extreme storms, extreme heat, drought,
freezing, tropical cyclones and other natural disasters. Water and energy
availability and reliability in the regions where we have facilities and where
our suppliers have operations is important to our business. Certain natural
disasters, including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding
could disrupt our operations and our suppliers’ or customers’ operations,
including by disrupting, the availability of energy or water necessary for the
operations of our business or those of our suppliers and customers. Global
climate change is also resulting in chronic changes that result in certain
natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which
could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our third parties. Such
disruptions could cause delays in manufacturing or shipping our products,
affect our supply chain and may result in the loss of business, and additional
costs to maintain or resume operations, any of which could adversely affect
our business and results of operation. We may also experience contractual
disputes relating to supply chain delays resulting from climate change related
disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. Data
centers depend on access to clean water and reliable energy, thus potential
power or water shortages could impair our customers’ ability to expand their
data center capacity and consume our products and services, which in turn
could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue.Although we maintain
insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the
types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on coverage,
availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad
exclusions. Additionally, our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling
to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could
materially harm our results of operations and financial condition.Our business
and the business of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to
climate-related regulations, and contract terms, and may be subject to
additional regulations and contract terms and lawsuits in the future. New
increased regulations regarding carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel
or energy taxes and other climate-related risks will likely result in greater
costs; for example, as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical
utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than
otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to
increased costs of doing business should they be affected by new climate-
related expectations such as those affecting abatement equipment, renewable
energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections. The
additional compliance costs incurred by our suppliers may be passed on to us
and result in greater indirect costs to us. These costs and restrictions could
materially harm our business and results of operations by increasing our
expenses, impacting our reputation if there is actual or perceived non-
compliance, or requiring us to alter our operations and products. The long-
term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology
industry are unclear but could be severe. Additionally, we are or expect to be
subject to various new or proposed climate-related disclosure requirements and
we expect to incur costs and resources in order to comply. Failure to
accurately comply with such reporting obligations may result in enforcement
actions, reputational harm or private litigation that could have a material
adverse effect on us.Legal and Regulatory RisksGovernment actions and
regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures
may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers. We have
equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with
Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity.
In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States
Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List,
including THATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time, the United States
administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy,
including policies with respect to China and Russia. Specifically, United
States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues
to add more Chinese companies to the Entity List and more regulations targeted
to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and emerging technologies
such as AI. Further, the United States and other countries and coalitions have
issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against
Russia, Belarus and the DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in
Ukraine. 28Table of ContentsIn October 2023, BIS issued new requirements for
certain advanced computing items that apply to the export of products
classified ECCN 3A090 or 4A090 to a party headquartered in, or with an
ultimate parent headquartered in, any of Country Groups D1, D4 or D5,
including China. These controls prevent us from shipping certain AMD Instinct™
integrated circuits and certain AMD Versal™ FPGAs to China, or to customers
outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5
country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us
to file a Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days
before shipping certain Versal FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the
United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country
(including China). The NAC notification process could result in BIS
prohibiting a shipment or requiring a license application before shipping a
product that is the subject of a NAC notification. BIS may issue new licensing
requirements and regulatory controls in the future. Even new products that
fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we have no
assurances BIS will agree that the alternative products are not subject to the
new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the
alternative products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or
increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or
retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result in lost sales
adversely impacting our reputation and business. There is also a possibility
of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or
other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or
suppliers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a
material adverse effect on our business. New export control restrictions may
adversely impact the ability of our research and development teams located
outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely
manner or at all. In addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect
our ability to provide services or develop products in the United
States.United States export control regulations include restrictions or
prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain AI technologies to United States
embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. If there
are changes to those regulations, or to the categorization of our products
under those regulations, our ability to sell our products and services outside
the United States may be harmed. The United States and its allies continue to
focus on export restrictions targeting semiconductors associated with AI,
including GPUs and associated products and services. The United States has
imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and in
the future is likely to further adopt other unilateral or multilateral
controls. The scope and application of such controls have been and may again
be very broad, which may prohibit us from exporting or providing access to our
products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not
limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and
warehousing locations, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability
to meet demand abroad. If these export controls targeting semiconductors
associated with AI including GPUs and associated products and services are
further tightened, our ability to export our technology, products or services
could be further restricted. We may be at a competitive disadvantage if our
competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally,
such export controls have, and may in the future, subject downstream
recipients of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,
repair or transfer of our products and may have a material adverse effect on
us. We may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that
is subject to the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are
administered by the U.S. Department of State. Export Administration Regulation
(EAR) governs the export and re-export of certain AMD products, including
FPGAs, as well as the transfer of related technologies or provision of
services, whether in the U.S. or abroad. We are required to maintain an
internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR
requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to
predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases
the difficulties of forecasting shipments. When we file license applications
or Notification Advanced Computing (NAC) exception notices we have no
assurance that BIS will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the BIS will
act on the filings in a timely manner. Even if BIS grants a requested license,
the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not
to fulfill. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could
result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent
licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas
customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and/or operating results. If we cannot realize our deferred tax
assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our deferred tax
assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be
used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future
periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to
determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely
than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax
assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period
in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations.29Table of ContentsIn
addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net
operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could
be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383,
separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The
limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or
tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes.Our business is
subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated
income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations,
changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable
assessments from tax audits, could affect our effective tax rates, financial
condition, and results of operations.We are a U.S.-based multinational company
subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and
foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment
is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws
are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new
interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws
could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax
rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including,
but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany
arrangements, and tax planning strategies.Our income tax expense is computed
based on tax rates enacted at the time of the respective financial period. Our
future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations
could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions
where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the
interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we
do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Many
countries have implemented legislation and other guidance to align their
international tax rules with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and
action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy,
including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules,
and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing
discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax
jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of
a global minimum tax (namely “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two”). Many countries we
do business in have implemented laws based on Pillar Two, which may materially
adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As
a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities
regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject
to review and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or
existing tax rulings, and may have a material adverse effect on us.In
addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic
and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result
from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final
determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on
our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations.In the
ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is
uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot
assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not
be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax
provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an
audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on
our cash, tax provisions and results of operations in the period or periods
for which that determination is made.We are party to litigation and may become
a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial
costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.From
time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as
described in Note 18 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements. For example, we have been subject to certain claims
concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are
purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to
consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action
claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed
to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities
and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex
factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that
if a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment
of damages that could be material to our business.30Table of ContentsWith
respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been
notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us
and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the
intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the
infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly
claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the
intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek
to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses
on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us
or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble
damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate
allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our
business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the
sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our
products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including
material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an
injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products
could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the
alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge
such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming
regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment
and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that
litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual
property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.Even
if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and
would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our
business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.We are
subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals regulations, as well as a
variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and
liabilities.Our operations and properties are subject to various United States
and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used
in our products and the manufacturing processes of our products, discharge of
pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. In
addition, our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by
regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict
materials), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or
regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution
of our products, and real property. For the manufacturing of our products,
these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for
operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although
our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we
cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be in complete
compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate
or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result,
including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing
processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil
liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing
suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or
reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and all
consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored,
released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current
or former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. We
have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale,
California and we are subject to Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from
the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three
sites and we have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible
parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other
parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the
primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain
responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as
all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their
obligations under the settlement agreements. The progress of future
remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may
change. Although we have not been, we could be named a potentially responsible
party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition,
contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other
facilities. Future environmental legal requirements may become more stringent
or costly. As such, the costs of complying with current and future
environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from
past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may increase
and could have a material adverse effect on us.31Table of
ContentsEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become
more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are
among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the
use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations
affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting
materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there
is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are
subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that
are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant
products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand,
which may result in excess inventory. Jurisdictions including the EU,
Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry
or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY
STAR specifications, and the like, as well as additional energy consumption
limits. Certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets
which could materially adversely affect us. We incur costs associated with
complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and
the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the EU, China and other
jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that
may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers are
increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our
supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the
complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently verify
the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed.
Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who
require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict
free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s
products. In addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such
components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate
change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result
of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we
purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain
manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business
should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example,
affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production
processes and materials selections.In addition to our Company, customers,
governments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced
labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program.
Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these
occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy
and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply
chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance
with laws and expectations. Our failure to satisfy customer expectations on
forced and trafficked labor policies may result in these customers choosing a
competitor’s product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges.In
addition, many governments have enacted laws around PII, such as the GDPR and
the CCPA, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions
by the governments. The GDPR imposes significant requirements on how we
collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for
non-compliance.New emerging technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep
pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. Given the complexity
and rapid development of AI, there are various current and proposed regulatory
frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. For example,
the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and its implementation will be phased in
over the next few years. In other jurisdictions, similar legislation is being
considered. Such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain
products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with
them. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging
technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost
of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all
which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. Governments are also considering the new issues in
intellectual property law that AI creates, which could result in different
intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and development
processes and procedures and could have a material adverse effect on our
business. 32Table of ContentsEvolving expectations from governments,
investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility
matters could result in additional costs, harm to our reputation and a loss of
customers.There are evolving expectations from governments, investors,
customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters
including those involving the environment and climate, energy and water
consumption, diversity and inclusion, human rights and cybersecurity.
Additionally, we are and expect to continue to be subject to various new and
proposed climate-related and sustainability laws and requirements that may
impact how we and our suppliers and customers conduct business or report on
business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions,
climate change-related risks and other sustainability matters related to our
business. As the nature, scope and complexity of corporate responsibility
reporting and disclosure requirements continue to evolve, we may incur
additional compliance costs and indirect compliance costs from our customers
and, suppliers that are passed on to us. In addition, certain corporate
responsibility laws and regulations may require us to modify our business or
supply chain in ways that are costly or less efficient. Emerging legal and
regulatory requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, can
be unpredictable, are subject to change, and may be difficult for us to comply
with given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced
manufacturing. For example, the state of California has passed reporting
requirements that will require corporations to report on climate data and
these laws include data assurance requirements that entail third-party
verifications. Our failure to comply, or the appearance of our failure to
comply, with these legal and regulatory requirements can result in regulatory
penalties, fines and legal liabilities, increase costs, and harm our
reputation – any of which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operation. While we have engaged, and in
the future may continue to engage, in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary
disclosures, certifications, goals, or targets, among others) or commitments
to improve our corporate responsibility profile and/or products or to respond
to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives or achievement of such
commitments may be costly, may not have the desired effect or may impact our
reputation with other stakeholders and have a material adverse effect on our
business. For example, we have publicly announced certain corporate
responsibility goals spanning multiple topics informed by input from various
of our stakeholders, including customers, investors and employees. These
goals, which reflect our current plans and aspirations based on known
conditions, may change in the future or may not be achieved, as they are
subject to various challenges, risks and expectations such as standards,
processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve or emerge, and many of
these matters are outside our control. Our progress towards some goals
receives third-party limited assurance and not reasonable assurance, or may
rely on receipt of others’ information and data that may not be subject to
either third-party limited or reasonable assurance. Any failure to achieve
such goals, failure to achieve these goals within the set timeframe, or in the
means expected, or the perception by stakeholders of such failure to achieve
these goals may result in reputational or financial harm. Simultaneously,
there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce companies’ efforts on certain
environmental, social and sustainability-related matters. Both advocates and
opponents of environmental, social and sustainability matters are increasingly
resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and
litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to
such activism or litigation, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise
adversely impact our business. Stakeholder groups may find our stated goals to
be insufficiently responsive to the implications of issues, such as climate
change, and any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives
that meet stakeholder expectations may result in loss of customers or in
investors selling their shares, which could harm our reputation and could have
a material adverse effect on our business.33Table of ContentsIssues related to
the responsible use of AI may result in reputational, competitive and
financial harm and liability.We offer products that include capabilities to
support AI deployment and we expect this part of our business to grow. As with
many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and
increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use
that could affect the adoption of AI, and thus our business. Third-party
misuse of AI applications, models, or solutions, or ineffective or inadequate
AI development or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause
harm to individuals or society and impair the public’s acceptance of AI.
Moreover, we may be subject to competitive harm, regulatory action and legal
liability as a result of new and proposed legislation regulating AI, as well
as new applications of existing data protection, privacy and intellectual
property and other laws. Such regulations and changes thereto could cause us
to incur greater compliance costs, could impact our ability to sell or the
ability of our customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use
systems that include our AI-related products and services and reduce the
number of customers, which could negatively impact our business and financial
results. As there continues to be an increasing focus on risks related to AI
technologies, there may be an increasing focus on regulatory restrictions that
target products and services that enable or facilitate AI and that may
negatively impact some of our AI-related products and services. If the AI-
related products that we offer have unintended consequences, infringe
intellectual property rights or rights of publicity, or are misused by our
customers or are otherwise controversial due to their perceived or actual
impact on human rights, privacy, cybersecurity, employment or other social,
economic or political issues the public’s acceptance of AI may be impaired and
this may also result in reputational, competitive and financial harm and
liability to our business.The agreements governing our notes, our guarantee of
the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose
restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our
business.The indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393%
Senior Notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to,
among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into
certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or
sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other
person.We unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, Xilinx’s
obligations under the Xilinx’s 2.375% Notes due 2030 (the Assumed Xilinx
Notes). The supplemental indenture governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes also
contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things,
create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain
subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect
to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another
person.We also have an unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate
principal amount of $3.0 billion (Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving
Credit Agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among
other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain
customary exceptions). In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us
to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each
fiscal quarter. The agreement governing our convertible notes and our
Revolving Credit Agreement contains provisions whereby a payment default or
acceleration under certain agreements with respect to other material
indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our convertible indenture or
the Revolving Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our
Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of
our indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and
payable. If the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement accelerate the
repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient
assets to repay those borrowings.Also, we enter into sale and factoring
arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables,
which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor
fails to pay for credit-related reasons and are not included in our
indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts
receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these
arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute
arises between us and an account debtor.34Table of ContentsMerger,
Acquisition, Divestiture, and Integration RisksAcquisitions, joint ventures,
and/or strategic investments, and the failure to integrate acquired
businesses, may fail to materialize their anticipated benefits and could
disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our results of operation
and financial condition. We have acquired and invested in businesses, and may
continue to do so, that offer products, services and technologies that we
believe will help expand our product offerings and services and grow our
business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and
competitive pressures. Acquisitions and joint ventures include numerous risks
including, but not limited to: our inability to identify suitable
opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us; failure to
complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all; inability to obtain, or
delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or IP disputes or other litigation;
difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all; and
failure of a transaction to advance our business strategy or other unforeseen
factors. For example, in August 2024, we completed our acquisition of Silo AI
Oy (Silo AI), and we entered into an agreement to acquire ZT Group Int’l, Inc.
(ZT Systems), which is currently expected to close in the first half of 2025,
subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing
conditions. Our ability to realize any of the anticipated benefits from an
acquisition depends on us successfully integrating the acquired business into
our business. Any acquisitions we may undertake, including Silo AI and ZT
Systems, involve certain integration risks and uncertainties including, but
not limited to: difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products,
policies, processes or operations and integrating and retaining the employees
including key personnel of the acquired business; diversion of capital and
other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business;
unanticipated costs or liabilities, such as increased interest expense and
compliance with debt covenants or other obligations; coordinating and
integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the
potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees,
vendors, suppliers and customers; our inability to effectively retain
suppliers, vendors and customers of the acquired businesses; entry into
geographic or business markets in which we have little or no experience;
adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the
acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the
acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture;
difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex
company; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired
companies’ financial reporting systems. If we cannot successfully integrate or
are delayed in integrating newly acquired businesses, it could negatively
impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to
grow our business, which could materially adversely affect our financial
conditions, results of operations or cash flows. Even if the businesses we
acquire are successfully integrated, the benefits of such transactions may not
be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. To complete an
acquisition, as contemplated by our intent to acquire ZT Systems, we may issue
equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could
adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume
contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of
acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We
may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent
events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered.
Acquisitions, joint ventures and other investments involve significant
challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business,
develop new products or sell our products, which could have a negative impact
on our results of operations. Acquisitions or joint ventures may also reduce
our cash available for operation and other uses which could harm our business.
For example, the majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs,
and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term
ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating
or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a
material adverse effect on our business. We may not realize the expected
benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, including the
receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain
licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BIS added certain Chinese
entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are
complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. 35Table of
ContentsFurthermore, we invest in both public and private companies to further
our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. We
invest in early-stage companies that may still be in the process of developing
a strategic direction and may not yet generate revenue. Many of the equity and
debt instruments that we invest in are non-marketable and illiquid at the time
of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. Our
ability to realize a return on our investments in private companies typically
depends on the company completing a liquidity event, such as a public offering
or acquisition. Market conditions and events, particularly in periods with
economic uncertainty, inflation, volatile public equity markets or unsettled
global market conditions, could cause our investments in public companies to
expose us to volatility in our results due to changes in market prices and/or
impairments. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest in are not
successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our
investment. Our investment portfolio is concentrated in specific sectors.
Adverse developments in one or any of these sectors due to regulatory changes,
technology disruptions or market downturns could negatively impact the
performance of our investment portfolio. Our ability to complete the
acquisition of ZT Systems is subject to closing conditions, including the
receipt of consents and approvals from government authorities, which may
impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition to
not be completed.Our acquisition of ZT Systems (the Acquisition), which is
expected to occur in the first half of 2025, is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of a number of customary conditions as specified in the purchase
agreement (the Agreement), including receipt of certain specified required
regulatory approvals and the absence of laws or orders restraining the
consummation of the Agreement, among others. We cannot assure you that we will
receive the necessary regulatory approvals at all or in a timely manner or
that closing conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the
Acquisition could cause us to not realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some
or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from this transaction.
Additionally, if the Acquisition is not completed, we may incur significant
acquisitions costs that we may be unable to recover, which could negatively
affect our business and results of operations. We would be required to pay ZT
Systems a termination fee of $300 million if the Agreement is terminated in
certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain required regulatory
approvals.We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems'
manufacturing business, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of
this transaction. We may not be able to divest the ZT Systems’ manufacturing
business on acceptable terms or at all. Divestitures involve certain risks and
uncertainties such as: inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;
failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals, or delay in receiving
such approvals; restrictions due to regulatory or governmental approval,
litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; changes in market
conditions or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions or industries in
which we or our counterparties operate; distraction of management; failure to
effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to
buyer; continued financial obligations and unanticipated liabilities; and
closing delays. Any one of these factors could delay the achievement of our
strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional transaction
expenses.36Table of ContentsAny impairment of our tangible, definite-lived
intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may
adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.We account
for certain acquisitions, including the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx), Pensando
Systems Inc. (Pensando) and Silo AI acquisitions, using the acquisition method
of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD
representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets
acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed,
at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the
purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be
recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx, Pensando and Silo AI
acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including
goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and
intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when
certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible
or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an
impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires
significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the
determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment
analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as
significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes
in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new
products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal
forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an
indicator of impairment. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and
future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and
potentially result in the impairment of tangible and intangible assets,
including goodwill, and may require us to record future impairment charges,
which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results
of operations.General RisksOur worldwide operations are subject to political,
legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material
adverse effect on us.We maintain operations around the world, including in the
United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on
third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all
product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at third-party
operated manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. Our shipping
services are provided by third-party subcontractors. We also have
international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net
revenue, were 66% for the year ended December 28, 2024. We expect that
international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales
in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated
with our worldwide operations include, without limitation: expropriation;
changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions;
changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing
requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual
property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different
employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange
rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries
between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic
conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; transportation
restrictions or disruptions; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and
tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to
international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws
and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the U.S. and
other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export
control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus, and the DNR and LNR
regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes
between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based
third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and
materially adversely affect delivery of products and our business, financial
condition and/or operating results. Moreover, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-
Hamas conflicts could escalate and expand, which in turn could have negative
impacts on the global economy and financial markets.37Table of ContentsIn
addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could
be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes,
tsunamis, flooding, tropical cyclones, droughts, fires, sea-level rise,
extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of
our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our California
operations are located near major earthquake fault lines. In April 2024,
Taiwan experienced an earthquake where our third-party wafer foundries are
located. We also have operations and employees in regions that have
experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves, wildfires and
freezing. Extreme weather events and natural disasters can also disrupt the
ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or
services for periods of time. In addition, certain natural disasters,
including drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, could
disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operations of our business
or the business of our suppliers or customers. Global climate change also may
result in chronic changes that result in certain natural disasters occurring
more frequently or with greater intensity, which could disrupt our operations,
or the operations of our third parties. There may be conflict or uncertainty
in the countries in which we, our customers and suppliers operate, including
public health issues, epidemics and pandemics, safety issues, natural
disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant
accidents or general economic or political factors. Global health outbreaks,
such as COVID-19, have and may continue to adversely affect our employees,
disrupt our business operations, as well those of our customers and suppliers.
Public health measures by government authorities may cause us to incur
additional costs, limit our operations, modify our business practices,
diminish employee productivity or disrupt our supply chain, which may have a
material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. has been and may continue to
be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales
and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political
instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be
able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us.
Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations,
or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed
conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or
customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the
transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could
materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer
spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. economy and
worldwide financial markets. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could
result in increased costs, shipment delays, general business interruptions,
the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining export licenses for certain
technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent
licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to
international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer
payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and
the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could
ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.We may incur future
impairments of our technology license purchases.We license certain third-party
technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We
report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we periodically evaluate the carrying value
of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such
as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to
the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence
of any of these events may require us to record future technology license
impairment charges.Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified
personnel may hinder our business.Much of our future success depends upon the
continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and
executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees
in the technology industry, especially in the areas of AI and machine
learning, is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our
organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to
continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified
employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development
programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. We
use share-based incentive awards to help attract, retain and motivate our
executives and qualified employees. If the value of such stock awards does not
appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or
if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable
benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and
employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also,
if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could
potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and
affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future
restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key
employees. 38Table of ContentsOur stock price is subject to volatility.Our
stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject
to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may
fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated
fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in
financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities
analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional
debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding
our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry
fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity
compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees.
In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business
and financing opportunities.We have an approved stock repurchase program that
authorizes repurchases of up to $12 billion of our common stock (Repurchase
Program). As of December 28, 2024, $4.7 billion remained available for future
stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program does
not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may
be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect
the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our
cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may
result in a decrease in our stock price.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF
COMMENTSNone.ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITYCybersecurity Risk Management and
StrategyWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management
program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of our critical systems and information. We design and assess our program
based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF), AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and other industry
practices and standards. This does not mean that we meet any particular
technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but only that we use the
NIST CSF, AI RMF, and other industry practices and standards as guides to help
us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our
business.Information about cybersecurity risks and our risk management
processes is collected, analyzed and considered as part of our overall
enterprise risk management program.Key components of our cybersecurity risk
management program include:•periodic risk assessments designed to help
identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services,
and our broader enterprise IT environment;•a security team principally
responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2)
our security controls, and (3) our detection and response to cybersecurity
incidents;•the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to
assess, evaluate, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security
controls and processes;•active testing including penetration tests, attack
simulations and tabletop exercises;•cybersecurity awareness training of our
employees, incident response personnel and senior management; •a cybersecurity
incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to
cybersecurity incidents; and•a third-party cyber risk management process for
vendors including, among other things, a security assessment and contracting
program for vendors based on their risk profile.39Table of ContentsAt this
time, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including
as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially
affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of
operations, or financial condition. We face certain ongoing risks from
cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially
affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations,
or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - IT outages, data loss, data
breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our
intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate
or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition
and results of operations.”Cybersecurity GovernanceOur Board considers
cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to
the Audit and Finance Committee (Committee) oversight of cybersecurity and
other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s
implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Committee
receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In
addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any
significant cybersecurity incidents.The Committee reports to the full Board
regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full
Board also receives a briefing from management on our cyber risk management
program at least annually. Board members receive presentations on
cybersecurity matters from our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),
information security team or external experts as part of the Board’s
continuing education on topics that impact public companies. The CISO reports
to the Chief Information Officer (CIO).Our CISO has primary responsibility for
our overall cybersecurity risk management program, and directly supervises
both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any retained external
cybersecurity consultants. Our CISO has over 19 years of experience in
cybersecurity including security operations, security architecture, identity
and access management, cloud security, vulnerability management, and
application/product security, policy, and compliance.Our CISO is informed
about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of
cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include,
among other things, briefings with internal security personnel, threat
intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or
private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and
reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment. ITEM 2.
PROPERTIESAs of December 28, 2024, we have approximately 6 million square feet
of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and
warehouse use throughout the world. These facilities include approximately 5
million square feet of leased space and approximately 1 million square feet of
owned space. Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California, and we
have significant operations in Austin, Texas; San Jose, California; Shanghai,
China; Markham, Ontario, Canada; Longmont, Colorado; Dublin, Ireland;
Singapore; and Bengaluru and Hyderabad, India. We also have a number of
regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers,
principally in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America.We currently
do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our
facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-
month occupancy or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that
our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and
that the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being
utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity.ITEM 3. LEGAL

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28, 2024
and December 30, 2023 and for each of the three years in the period ended
December 28, 2024 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form
10-K, “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.”IntroductionIn this section, we will describe the general financial
condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including
a discussion of our results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023, an
analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-
balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year
comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can
be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.OverviewIn 2024, we delivered
strong annual revenue growth with net revenue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion,
compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. This growth was driven by the performance
of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net revenue of $12.6
billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driven by higher
sales of our AMD Instinct™ GPUs and AMD EPYC™ CPUs. Client segment net revenue
of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023,
primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen™ mobile and desktop processors.
The increase in annual net revenue was partially offset by a decrease in net
revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segments. Gaming net revenue of $2.6
billion decreased by 58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net
revenue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue. Embedded net
revenue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net revenue of $5.3
billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inventory levels.During the
year, we successfully launched multiple leadership products and made
significant progress executing our AI strategy. One of our priorities in 2024
was to accelerate growth in our Data Center segment. The demand for our Data
Center AI accelerator products was very strong led by large hyperscale cloud
customers deploying our AMD Instinct MI300X GPU accelerators. During the year,
we unveiled an accelerated AMD Instinct accelerator roadmap to deliver an
annual cadence of leadership AI solutions. To further expand our high-
performance server CPU portfolio, we launched our 5th Gen AMD EPYC™
processors, formerly codenamed “Turin,” built with our latest “Zen 5” core
architecture designed to deliver leadership performance and efficiency.We took
a major step in our AI PC roadmap with the launch of AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series
processors that combine leadership compute capabilities based on our “Zen 5”
architecture and an industry-leading neural processing unit (NPU) powered by
our XDNA 2 architecture for next-generation AI PCs. We added to our Ryzen
family of desktop CPUs with the Ryzen 9000 series processors for laptop and
desktop PCs that deliver leadership performance in gaming, productivity and
content creation. In our Gaming segment, we extended our multigenerational
partnership with Sony as they introduced the PlayStation® 5 Pro, which
features a new AMD semi-custom SoC designed to deliver increases in graphics
and ray tracing performance to enable AI-driven upscaling.We expanded our
adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions with the launch of
the new Versal™ Series Gen 2 devices, including the new Versal AI Edge Series
Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs, which bring preprocessing,
AI inference, and postprocessing together in a single device for end-to-end
acceleration of AI-driven embedded systems.To execute our AI strategy, we
brought together multiple AI teams across AMD to drive development of a
comprehensive software ecosystem spanning our full product portfolio. We made
several key optimizations and introduced new features in the latest AMD ROCm™
software that increased performance in key generative AI workloads, expanded
support and optimization for additional frameworks and libraries, and
simplified the overall developer experience. We also made strategic
investments to further expand our AI software capabilities with the
acquisition of Silo AI Oy (Silo AI), an AI lab based in Finland. The
acquisition of Silo AI enables customers to accelerate development and
deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI has also developed a software
stack used to train multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on
AMD Instinct accelerators that can accelerate the development of highly-
performant AMD training solutions.43Table of ContentsWe also focused on
extending our data center infrastructure capabilities by entering into an
agreement in August 2024 to acquire ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (ZT Systems), a
provider of AI and general purpose compute infrastructure for hyperscale
computing companies. We believe that with the acquisition of ZT Systems, we
can accelerate time to market for our leadership AI training and inferencing
solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal
year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing
conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems'
manufacturing business.Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue, was 49%
for 2024, compared to 46% in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily
due to a favorable shift in revenue mix with higher Data Center and Client
revenues, lower Gaming revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower
Embedded revenue. Operating income for 2024 was $1.9 billion compared to
operating income of $401 million for 2023. The increase in operating income
was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increased R&D;
investments. Net income for 2024 was $1.6 billion compared to $854 million in
the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher
revenue.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 28,
2024 were $5.1 billion, compared to $5.8 billion at the end of 2023. Our
aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 28, 2024 was $1.8
billion, compared to $2.5 billion as of December 30, 2023. We repaid our 2.95%
Senior Notes due 2024 with a principal amount of $750 million in June
2024.During the twelve months ended December 28, 2024, we returned a total of
$862 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 5.9 million shares of
common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 28, 2024, $4.7
billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program.
The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock,
has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.We
intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations
that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our
financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial
statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those
changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect
our financial statements. Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts in our Consolidated Financial
Statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those
related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible
assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have
historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the
actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be
affected by different assumptions or conditions.Management believes the
following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the
presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult,
subjective and complex judgments.Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with
our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8
through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we
are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of
consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of
consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the
contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment
manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price
protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers.We base our
determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to
actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical
returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted,
as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current
economic conditions, or both.Our estimates of necessary adjustments for
distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by
distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor
customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external
market data analysis.44Table of ContentsOur estimates of necessary adjustments
for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements,
actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate
program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis.We
offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing
promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we
recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is
recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of
when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is
offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the
customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and
promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue
unless they qualify for expense recognition.We also provide limited product
return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return
rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s
prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional
product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable
facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to
account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to
distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical
product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known
information or events, as applicable.Overall, our estimates of adjustments to
contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and
distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if
any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results;
however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual
provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions,
resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.Inventory
Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the
lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about
future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate
necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product
and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or
obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in
business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for
our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In
determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider
assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as
well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a
change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less
favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be
required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative
impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to
sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate
realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded
with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net
benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of
inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with
actual results.Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting
units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within
four reporting units: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded. We perform our
goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each
year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss
may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include
both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an
impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds
its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value
of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed
their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a
quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the
assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the
fair value of our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse
changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future
could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could
result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges
of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual qualitative impairment
test, we concluded it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of
each reporting unit exceeded its fair value. 45Table of ContentsLong-Lived and
Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are
reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at
least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators
are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for
impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of
impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted
cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash
flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the
assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on
the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or
based on appraisals.Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial
statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments.
These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax
liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax
assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of
assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.We
regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred
tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability
level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the
form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate
will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance
recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we
determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets,
we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would
result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in
the period of reversal.In determining the need to establish or maintain a
valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable
income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent
tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing
temporary differences and carryforwards. The federal valuation allowance
maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or
383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain
state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of
sufficient sources of future taxable income.In addition, the calculation of
our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of
complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future
adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or
other taxing authorities. Results of OperationsAdditional information on our
reportable segments is contained in Note 4 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to
Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).Our operating results
tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally
higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year,
although market conditions and product transitions could impact these
trends.46Table of ContentsThe following table provides a summary of net

AMD Instinct GPUs and AMD EPYC CPUs.Data Center operating income was $3.5
billion in 2024, compared to operating income of $1.3 billion in 2023. The
increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, partially
offset by higher R&D; investment. ClientClient net revenue of $7.1 billion in
2024 increased by 52%, compared to net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2023,
primarily due to a 34% increase in unit shipments and a 13% increase in
average selling price driven by strong demand for AMD mobile and desktop Ryzen
processors. Client operating income was $897 million in 2024, compared to
operating loss of $46 million in 2023. The increase in operating income was
primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating
expenses. GamingGaming net revenue of $2.6 billion in 2024 decreased by 58%,
compared to net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net revenue
was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue. Gaming operating
income was $290 million in 2024, compared to operating income of $971 million
in 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower
revenue. EmbeddedEmbedded net revenue of $3.6 billion in 2024 decreased by
33%, compared to net revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023. The decrease in net
revenue was primarily due to lower demand as customers continued to normalize
their inventory levels. Embedded operating income was $1.4 billion in 2024,
compared to operating income of $2.6 billion in 2023. The decrease in
operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue.All OtherAll Other
operating loss of $4.2 billion in 2024 primarily consisted of $2.4 billion of

revenue.ExpensesResearch and Development ExpensesResearch and development
expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared
to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-
related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.
Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, general and
administrative expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or
18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in go-to-market activities to support our revenue growth.
Amortization of Acquisition-Related IntangiblesAmortization of acquisition-
related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or
15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to
certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior
fiscal year.Restructuring ChargesWe recognized $186 million of restructuring
charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024
Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driving
efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest
growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets. Licensing GainWe hold
equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with
Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity.
We recognized $48 million and $34 million of licensing gain from royalty
income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, in 2024 and 2023,
respectively. 48Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseInterest expense of $92
million in 2024 decreased by $14 million compared to $106 million in 2023,
primarily due to repayment of the 2.95% Senior Notes due in June 2024.Other
Income (expense), netOther income (expense), net is primarily comprised of
interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity
investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.Other income
(expense), net was $181 million in 2024 compared to $197 million of Other
income, net in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in interest
income from lower balances held in short-term investments compared to the
prior year.Income Tax Provision (Benefit)We recorded an income tax provision
of $381 million in 2024 and an income tax benefit of $346 million in 2023,
representing effective tax rates of 19% and (68%), respectively. The increase
in income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and
a $373 million tax effect from an intercompany integration transaction. Global
Minimum TaxThe OECD is continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes
in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do
business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the
“Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). The Council of the European Union
has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two
and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar
Two. Many countries, including non-EU member states, have implemented laws
based on Pillar Two proposals, with effective dates that started in 2024.
Although many countries have already introduced Pillar Two legislation
applicable to us effective in 2024, certain jurisdictions in which we operate
have not adopted corresponding legislation to date. For 2024, the impact to us
associated with Pillar Two was immaterial. We continue to evaluate the impact
of proposed and enacted legislative changes to our effective tax rate and cash
flows as new guidance becomes available.International SalesInternational sales
as a percentage of net revenue were 66% in 2024 and 65% in 2023. We expect
that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total
sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions
are denominated in U.S. dollars.FINANCIAL CONDITIONLiquidity and Capital
ResourcesAs of December 28, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term

available under an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on April
29, 2027. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during the year ended
December 28, 2024.49Table of ContentsWe also have a commercial paper program
to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount
outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days
from the date of issue. We did not issue any commercial paper during the year
ended December 28, 2024.Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $1.8
billion as of December 28, 2024. Our 2.95% Notes with a principal amount of
$750 million were repaid in June 2024 and our remaining debt will mature
starting in 2030.As of December 28, 2024, we had unconditional purchase
commitments of approximately $5.0 billion, of which $4.5 billion are in fiscal
year 2025. Our contractual obligations and purchase commitments relate
primarily to our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third
parties and future payments related to certain software and technology
licenses and IP licenses. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on
the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into
account business conditions. See Note 17 – Commitments and Guarantees.On
August 17, 2024, we agreed to acquire ZT Systems. Upon closing of the
acquisition, we will pay approximately $3.4 billion in cash and 8,335,852
shares of AMD common stock and to the extent certain conditions are met, we
will pay an additional $300 million of cash and up to 740,964 shares of AMD
common stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal
year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing
conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems'
manufacturing business.We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments and cash flows from operations along with our revolving credit
facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations,
including capital expenditures, purchase commitments, and acquisitions over
the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the
capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure
that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Operating
ActivitiesOur working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations
consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for
inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.Net cash
provided by operating activities was $3 billion in 2024, primarily due to our
net income of $1.6 billion in 2024, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $3.5
billion and net cash outflows of $2.1 billion from changes in our operating
assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets
and liabilities included a $1.9 billion increase in accounts receivable driven
primarily by higher revenue in the last month of 2024 compared to the last
month of 2023, and a $1.5 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by
a build of inventory to support the ramp of new products in advanced process
nodes.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2023,
primarily due to our net income of $854 million in 2023, adjusted for non-cash
adjustments of $3.9 billion and net cash outflows of $3 billion from changes
in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in
operating assets and liabilities included a $1.3 billion increase in accounts
receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the last month of 2023
compared to the last month of 2022, and a $580 million increase in inventories
driven primarily by a build of inventory to support the ramp of new products
in advanced process nodes.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing
activities was $1.1 billion in 2024, which primarily consisted of cash used
for purchases of short-term investments of $1.5 billion, $636 million for
purchases of property and equipment, and cash used in acquisitions, net of
cash acquired of $548 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of
short-term investments of $1.4 billion and sale of short-term investments of
$616 million.Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2023,
which primarily consisted of cash used for purchases of short-term investments
of $3.7 billion, $546 million for purchases of property and equipment, and
cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $131 million, partially
offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $2.7 billion
and the sale of short-term investments of $300 million.50Table of
ContentsFinancing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $2.1
billion in 2024, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $862
million under the Repurchase Program, repurchases to cover tax withholding on
employee equity plans of $728 million, and repayment of the 2.95% Notes of
$750 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock
under our employee equity plans of $279 million. Net cash used in financing
activities was $1.1 billion in 2023, which primarily consisted of common stock
repurchases of $985 million under the Repurchase Program and repurchases to
cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $427 million, partially
offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity
plans of $268 million.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 28, 2024,
we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.51Table of ContentsITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in
investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms.
Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions.
As of December 28, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income
instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our
investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal
and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we
place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of
credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage
point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates on December
28, 2024 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and
investment portfolio by approximately $6 million. As of December 28, 2024, all
of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest
expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.We will continue to monitor
our exposure to interest rate risk.Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in
our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities
and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant
reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our
portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active
secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to
principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default
risk and market risk.We actively monitor market conditions and developments
specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe
that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest
only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do
not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As
of December 28, 2024, all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated
by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent
measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully
eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.Foreign Exchange
Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales
of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign
currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to
mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The
following table provides information about our foreign currency forward
contracts as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. All of our foreign
currency forward contracts mature within 24 months. December 28, 2024December

PoliciesFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on
the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 ended on
December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2022
consisted of 53 weeks.Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.Reclassification and Change in Presentation. Unbilled
receivables of $1.1 billion as of December 30, 2023 were reclassified from
within Accounts receivable, net to within Prepaid expenses and other current
assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Statements of
Cash Flows to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those
estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited
to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-
lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is
recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and
is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-
added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or
services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated
with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all of the
Company’s revenue is derived from product sales.Customers are generally
required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard
contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has
determined that it does not have significant financing components in its
contracts with customers.Non-custom productsThe Company transfers control and
recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which
includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in
accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled
to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells
to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain
rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The
Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and
distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product
returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual
historical experience and any known events. 59Table of ContentsThe Company
offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative
advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing
arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the
Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is
recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the
later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program
is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a
portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or
marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a
reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition.Constraints
of variable consideration have not been material.Custom productsCustom
products, which are primarily associated with the Company’s Gaming segment,
are sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an
enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company
at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production
of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input
method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the
amount of revenue to recognize for in-process or completed customer orders at
a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the
most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance
obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the
Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation.Sales of custom products
are not subject to a right of return and arrangements generally involve a
single performance obligation. Generally, there are no variable consideration
estimates associated with custom products.Development and intellectual
property licensing agreementsFrom time to time, the Company may enter into
arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services
and a license to the right to use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are
deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature
of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over
time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The
Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing
component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii)
distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it
is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation
and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at
a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the
license.From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with
customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP.
Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the
designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is
recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit
from the license.There are no variable consideration estimates associated with
either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements
involving either the sale or licensing of IP.InventoriesThe Company values
inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost
or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its
products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and
economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its
products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining
the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers
assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as
well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for
inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete.
The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess
inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase
orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as
anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish
further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the
Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be
required.60Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsThe Company is required to
use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The
acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to allocate the purchase
consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquiree
based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess
of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these
assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When
determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with
respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets
include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and
margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer
relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are
based on the assumptions that management believes a market participant would
use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently
uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates
made.GoodwillThe Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the
first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or
circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a
more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and
quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.The Company has
the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations,
overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization
and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than
not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the
Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the
Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the
qualitative test, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If a
reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value,
a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the
reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the
total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Long-Lived and
Intangible AssetsLong-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are
reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at
least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators
are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for
impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.When indicators of
impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future
undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event
such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded
value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the
asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets
held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately
identifiable positive cash flows.When assets are removed from operations and
held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the
carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are
among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any
of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods
for assets held for use or assets held for sale.Cash EquivalentsCash
equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into
cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase. Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are primarily comprised of
trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance
for credit loss. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk
through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit
approvals. While the Company maintains an allowance for customer credit
losses, its accounts receivable write-offs have historically not been
significant. 61Table of ContentsUnbilled ReceivablesUnbilled receivables are
recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unbilled receivables primarily represent work
completed on development services and on custom products under non-cancellable
purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract
inception, recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to
customers.InvestmentsAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities. Investments in
marketable debt securities are available for use in current operations,
including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and are classified within
current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Available-for-sale debt
securities are recorded at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the Consolidated
Statements of Comprehensive Income until realized. Fair value is determined
based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are
observable. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated
fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is
caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are
recognized in other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of tax, are included in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), in Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. The Company uses the first-in, first-out method as basis
of the cost of securities sold.Strategic Non-marketable Equity Securities. The
Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies
are held for long-term strategic purposes and are accounted for under the
measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for
subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for
impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may
have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by
considering available evidence, including the investee’s general market and
industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses
the investee’s ability to meet business milestones, its financial condition,
and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its
cash, the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation
and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee. Fair Value Measurements The
Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-
held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement
alternative. Fair Value HierarchyThe fair value framework requires the
categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the
assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for
fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair
value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:Level 1 —
Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in
Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability.Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to
the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets
and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation
techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. Property
and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of two to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and
leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of
the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.62Table
of ContentsLeasesOperating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use
(ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset
for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to
make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU
assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of
lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease
payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable.
When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses
its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing
capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. When using the
incremental borrowing rate, the Company utilizes the consolidated group
incremental borrowing rate. Lease expense for operating lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has
elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease
liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any
class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease
ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease
liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s
finance leases are immaterial.Foreign Currency Translation/TransactionsThe
functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured
into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and
liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and
liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at
average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of
sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts
which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses
from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and
Advertising ExpensesAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition,
the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative
advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs
are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative
advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative
expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value
of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the
estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a
reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2024, 2023
and 2022 were approximately $1.2 billion, $695 million and $683 million,
respectively. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company estimates stock-based
compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s
fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted
stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s
common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair
value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation
model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued
under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-
Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of
the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the
compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions
(PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the
service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture
rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates.ContingenciesFrom time to time the Company is a defendant or
plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of
business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax
claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In
addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local,
regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near
locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business.
The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or
outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible
losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these
commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any,
includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the
amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to
new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change
in settlement strategy.63Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe Company computes the
provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred
tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial
statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax
assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect
for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled
and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot
conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets
will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is
performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the
Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is
more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical
merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority.
Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recorded within the Income
tax provision (benefit) line in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income
(GILTI) tax in the U.S. and recognizes deferred taxes for temporary basis
differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years.
Recently Issued Accounting Standard Updates AdoptedIn November 2023, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update
(ASU) 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment
Disclosures to enhance disclosures about significant segment expenses. This
ASU is effective for the Company’s fiscal year 2024 and interim periods in
fiscal year 2025. The Company adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of
2024. See Note 4 - Segment Reporting for further information. Recently Issued

remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected
duration of more than one year was $85 million, of which $67 million is
expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to
remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an
original expected duration of one year or less.Revenue recognized over time
associated with custom products and development services accounted for
approximately 8%, 25% and 24% of the Company’s revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.NOTE 4 – Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief
Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue,
consolidated cost of sales and operating expenses and operating income (loss).
These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the
reportable segments based on management’s judgment. The CODM is regularly
provided segment operating income to assess relative segment performance.
65Table of ContentsThe Company’s four reportable segments are:•the Data Center
segment, which primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators,
server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated
processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-
on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers; •the Client segment, which primarily
includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks; •the Gaming
segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, and semi-custom SoC products
and development services; and•the Embedded segment, which primarily includes
embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC
products.From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of
its IP portfolio.In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an
All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily
includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the
reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and
credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This
category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles,
employee stock-based compensation, acquisition-related and other costs,
restructuring charges and licensing gain. Acquisition-related and other costs
primarily include transaction costs, purchase price fair value adjustments for
inventory, certain compensation charges, contract termination costs and
workforce rebalancing charges.66Table of ContentsThe following table provides

FacilityThe Company has $3 billion available under a revolving credit
agreement, as amended, that expires on April 29, 2027 (Revolving Credit
Agreement). As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had no

rate per annum equal to the applicable SOFR plus a margin between 0.575% and
1.20%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest equal to the Base Rate plus a
margin between 0.000% and 0.20%. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains
a sustainability-linked pricing component which provides for interest rate and
facility fee reductions or increases based on the Company meeting or missing
targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas
emissions. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations
and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default
applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. As of December 28, 2024, the
Company was in compliance with these covenants.Commercial PaperOn November 3,

Transactions and Derivative Financial InstrumentsForeign Currency Forward
Contracts Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Company enters into foreign
currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange
rate risk related to future forecasted transactions denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. Dollar. These contracts generally mature within 24 months
and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 28, 2024 and December
30, 2023, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency
forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $2.2 billion and $2.4
billion, respectively. The fair value of these contracts as of December 28,
2024 is recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Accrued
liabilities and Other long-term liabilities of $6 million, $60 million and $11
million, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the fair value of these
contracts was recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and
Accrued liabilities of $24 million and $18 million, respectively.Foreign
Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Company also
enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term
effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts
generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges.
As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the notional value of these
outstanding contracts was $642 million and $568 million, respectively. The
fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 28, 2024 and
December 30, 2023. The cash flows associated with derivative instruments as
cash flow hedging instruments are classified in the same category within the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of the related
items.75Table of ContentsNOTE 10 – Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale
debt securities, equity investments and trade receivables.The Company places
its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time
an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and
financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in
bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which
have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.The Company
believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up
the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer
accounted for approximately 24% and another customer accounted for 16% of the
total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 28, 2024 and
December 30, 2023, respectively. However, the Company does not believe the
receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk
based on past collection experience and review of their current credit
quality. The Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by
counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are
large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to
meet its financial obligations to the Company. NOTE 11 – Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares
outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by
applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs
(including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants. The
following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per
share:Year EndedDecember 28, 2024December 30, 2023December 31, 2022 (In

of the Company’s common stock (Repurchase Program). During the year ended
December 28, 2024, the Company repurchased 5.9 million shares of its common
stock under the Repurchase Program for $862 million. As of December 28, 2024,
$4.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this
program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any
common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at
any time.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company’s employee equity programs are
intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On May
18, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the AMD 2023 Equity Incentive
Plan (the 2023 Plan), which supersedes the AMD 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and
the Xilinx, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Plans). Outstanding
awards granted under the Prior Plans will continue to be governed by the terms
of the Prior Plans but no awards may be made under the Prior Plans on or after
May 18, 2023. Under the 2023 Plan, 87,645,874 shares of the Company’s common
stock are reserved and available for delivery pursuant to awards granted under
the 2023 Plan. Generally, stock options granted under the 2023 Plan vest and
become exercisable over a four-year period from the date of grant and expire
within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares from the 2023 Plan
that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards
become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2023
Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-
based RSUs and PRSUs. Stock Options. Under the 2023 Plan, nonstatutory and
incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares
subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be
less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the
date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2023
Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.Time-based RSUs. Time-
based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or
consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares
of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and
conditions are satisfied. PRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the
Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial
performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU
award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to
an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial
performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual
number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may
range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree
of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual
award.77Table of ContentsESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who
participate in an offering period may have up to 15% of their eligible
earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common
stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last
business day of the six-month offering period. The offering periods commence
in May and November each year. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had 60
million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 34
million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock
options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2023 Plan
and the Prior Plans.Valuation and ExpenseStock-based compensation expense was

in income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and
a $373 million tax effect from an intercompany integration transaction.
81Table of ContentsBeginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D; expenditures
rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an
increase in 2024 and 2023 taxable income which also increased the income
eligible for the FDII tax benefit. As a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as
a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has
made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion
Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax
on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to
the current year pre-tax loss in Singapore, the Company did not receive any
income tax or earnings per share benefit. Deferred income taxes reflect the
net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the
Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2024 and

an intercompany integration transaction and remeasured associated deferred
taxes, resulting in increases to the deferred tax liability for acquisition-
related intangibles and the deferred tax asset for Capitalized R&D;, partially
offset by a decrease in the deferred tax liability for GILTI.The movement in
the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows:December 28, 2024December

of ContentsThrough the end of fiscal year 2024, the Company continued to
maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain
federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance
maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or
383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain
state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient
sources of future taxable income. The Company’s U.S. federal and state net
operating losses (NOLs) carryforwards as of December 28, 2024, were $134
million and $362 million, respectively. NOLs may be subject to limitations by
the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $27 million of U.S. federal
NOLs will expire between 2025 and 2037, and $107 million of federal NOLs have
no expiration date. State NOLs will expire at various dates through 2043. The
difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred tax assets and their related
valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company’s tax returns are
the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken for which an
income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $12 million
will expire at various dates between 2037 and 2042. The state tax return
credits of $804 million will expire at various dates between 2025 and 2039,
except for the California R&D; credit, which does not expire. The Company also
has $620 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between
2028 and 2044. A reconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax
benefits was as follows:December 28, 2024December 30, 2023December 31, 2022

$1,361 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective
tax rate if recognized was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of
December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The
Company had $298 million, $142 million and $81 million of accrued penalties
and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2024,
December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 28, 2024
and December 30, 2023, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities
related to unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion, recorded under Other
long-term liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings
from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material
jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the
taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for
audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019
are currently under audit by the IRS. It is possible the Company may have tax
audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of
the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and
settlements are highly uncertain. Under current U.S. tax law, the impact of
future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely
reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local
jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. There were no
cumulative undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested that could
be subject to withholding taxes as of December 28, 2024.83Table of

and Guarantees Operating LeasesThe Company has entered into operating and
finance leases for its corporate offices, data centers, research and
development facilities and certain equipment. The leases expire at various
dates through 2038, some of which include options to extend the lease for up
to ten years.For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $147 million, $127
million and $118 million, respectively, of operating lease expense, including
short-term lease expense. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded $83
million, $46 million, and $40 million respectively, of variable lease expense,
which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with
the usage of facilities under the operating leases. For 2024, 2023, and 2022
cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows was $155
million $147 million and $108 million, respectively. The Company’s finance and
short-term leases are immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. Supplemental information related to leases is as follows:December

Company’s purchase commitments primarily include the Company’s obligations to
purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related
to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. Purchase
commitments include obligations made under noncancellable purchase orders and
contractual obligations requiring minimum purchases or for which cancellation
would lead to significant penalties.Total future unconditional purchase

works with suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase
commitments, taking into account business conditions.Warranties and
IndemnitiesThe Company generally warrants that its products sold to its
customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects
in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The
Company may also offer, in general, one to three-year limited warranties based
on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The
Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of
warranted products. Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product
warranty during 2024 and 2023 are as follows:December 28,2024December 30,2023
(In millions)Beginning balance$85 $65 Provisions during the period213 126
Settlements during the period(110)(106)Ending balance$188 $85 In addition to
product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of
business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual
relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions
with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters,
the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific
types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of
representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products
when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe
the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims
made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the
maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations
due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in
each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments
made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In
addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has
been immaterial.NOTE 18 – Contingencies Litigation and Other Legal MattersAs
of December 28, 2024, there were no material legal proceedings. 85Table of
ContentsThe Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose
in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on
management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range
of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows.86Table of ContentsReport of
Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board
of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.Opinion on the Financial
StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and
December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 28, 2024 and
December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report
dated February 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for
OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical
audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of
the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on
the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
relates.87Table of ContentsInventory ValuationDescription of the MatterAt
December 28, 2024, the Company’s net inventory balance was $5,734 million. As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the
estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand
inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand, and by considering recent
historical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s
inventory excess and obsolescence reserves involved significant judgment
because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by
market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In
estimating excess and obsolescence reserves, management developed certain
assumptions, including forecasted demand which are sensitive to the
competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life
cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be
affected by future economic and market conditions.How We Addressed the Matter
in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the
operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory
excess and obsolescence reserves estimation process, including the basis for
developing the above-described assumptions and management’s judgments.Our
audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of
management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and
completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of excess and
obsolescence reserves. We compared the quantities and carrying value of on-
hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, and
evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management’s adjustments to such
sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with
product life cycles. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying
management's estimates by comparing management’s historical forecasts to
actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed
sensitivity analyses over the forecasted demand used by management to
determine inventory excess and obsolescence reserves./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe

Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices,
Inc.Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related
notes and our report dated February 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.89Table of
ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURENone.ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESDisclosure Controls and
ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this
Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 28, 2024, the
end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is
performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic
reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation
activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them, as
necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems
that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial ReportingInternal control over financial reporting
refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of
Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures
that: 1.Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; 2.Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3.Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial
reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting
objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance
and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human
failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations,
there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these
inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.
Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce,
though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company.91Table of ContentsManagement has used the 2013 framework set forth in
the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 28, 2024 at the reasonable assurance
level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, which is included in Part II,
Item 8, above. Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere has
been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our
most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATIONDuring the quarterly period ended December
